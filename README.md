🌦️ Weather App – Real-Time Weather with Autocomplete

A beginner-friendly web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from WeatherAPI. Users can search for any city or state and see current temperature, condition, and an icon — with background changes based on weather type.

✨ Features:

🔍 City/state autocomplete suggestions
🌡️ Live temperature and condition display
🎨 Dynamic background & weather icon
⚡ Uses fetch() and async/await for API calls

This is part of my learning journey into frontend development. I built this project with self-learning and some help from ChatGPT to understand API integration and DOM manipulation.
